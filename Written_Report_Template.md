# Louise Kickstarter

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of *Louiseâ€™s* play Fever analysis was to find out how two campaigns behaved in different manners.  Data was accumulated for the use of Pivot Charts and Pivot Tables

During the years from 2009 - 2017, we found that campaigns  with lower goals seem to have better results than those with higher goals.  Fundraiser with higher goals resulted in a higher failure rate.

# Analysis and Challenges

## Analysis of *Fever*

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
### Launch date aoutcomes seem to be average for the yeas 2009 - 2017.  Out of 4,114 campaigns, only 50 are still live which really didn't affect the outcome of success.
### A pivot table was used for this analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### During our investigation on successful fundraising campaigns, we found that *Fever* had a higher successful rate when the goals were lower.  The opposite can be said for higher goals.  These campaigns had a higher failure rate as seen in this line chart.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

### The pivot charts show a great deal of information but they do have limitations.  For instance, there are a lot of small campaigns that could be counted out so the natural distribution can be stronger.  Using line graphs are too busy for this high amount of data. Obtaining data and placing it in excel, one must be very careful.  One wrong letter or number and the data could be skewed.  

### Example *=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$F:$F,"=successful",Kickstarter!$D:$D,">=1000", Kickstarter!D:D,"<5000", Kickstarter!$U:$U, "=plays")*

### Pie charts could be used but caution, they are difficult to read so they may be used for small amounts of comparison.
