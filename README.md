## This project aims to analyze the impact of launch dates and funding goals on the success of Kickstarter campaigns. The performance of Louise's play, Fever will be analyzed by using Excel's pivot tables and VLOOKUP function. The final report will include visualizations that effectively communicate the relationship between launch dates, funding goals, and campaign outcomes.
